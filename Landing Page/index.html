                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web)
                        or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single
                        static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network
                        services.

                    <h3> App Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile application development is the process of making software for smartphones, tablets and
                        digital assistants, most commonly for the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be
                        preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web
                        browser.

                    <h3> UI/UX Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        UX design focuses on the interaction that a human user has with everyday products and services.
                        The goal of UX design is to make using these products and services, both digital or physical,
                        easy, logical, and fun.You may have spent your fair share of time searching reviews for a new
                        coffee maker.
